Chapter 3: Rescue Basics

1. Describe the steps an OEC technician can take to be prepared when responding to a request for assistance.
2. Describe how layering clothing can help preserve body heat.
3. Describe five modes of disease transmission.
4. Describe the following terms: pathogen, standard precautions, body substance isolation, and hazardous material.
5. List common personal protective equipment used by OEC technicians.
6. Demonstrate how to safety remove contaminated medical gloves.
7. Describe the chain of custody.



Here are the key steps an Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) technician can take to be prepared when responding 
to a request for assistance:

1. Ensure Personal Safety: Assess and secure the scene to ensure it is safe to approach, and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
2. Gather Equipment: Carry essential medical supplies and tools, ensuring they are organized and accessible for quick use.
3. Perform a Scene Size-up: Evaluate the environment, potential hazards, the number of patients, and the mechanism of injury or illness.
4. Establish Communication: Communicate with other responders, dispatch, or bystanders to gather critical information and coordinate efforts.
5. Maintain a Calm and Focused Attitude: Stay calm and composed to ensure clear thinking and effective decision-making during the response.

These steps help ensure an OEC technician can respond effectively and provide appropriate care in emergency situations.



Layering clothing helps preserve body heat by creating a system of insulation and temperature regulation through three main layers:

1. Base Layer: Wicks moisture away from the skin to keep the body dry, preventing heat loss due to dampness from sweat.
2. Middle Layer (Insulating Layer): Traps body heat by creating air pockets between fibers, providing warmth and insulation against the cold.
3. Outer Layer (Shell): Protects against wind, rain, and snow, preventing external conditions from cooling the body and maintaining the insulation provided by the inner layers.

This system allows for temperature control by adding or removing layers based on activity level and environmental conditions, helping to retain body heat and prevent hypothermia.




Here’s a description of  infection control and safety terms:

1. Pathogen: A microorganism, such as a virus, bacteria, fungus, or parasite, that causes disease in humans or other organisms.
2. Standard Precautions: A set of infection control practices used to prevent transmission of diseases by treating all blood, body fluids, and potentially infectious materials as if they are infectious, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
3. Body Substance Isolation (BSI): A form of infection control that focuses on isolating all body substances (blood, urine, saliva, etc.) to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens between patients and healthcare workers.
4. Hazardous Material (HazMat): Any substance that poses a significant risk to health, safety, or the environment, including chemicals, radioactive materials, biological agents, and other potentially harmful substances.

These terms are essential in understanding infection control and safety in medical and emergency care environments.




Here are five modes of disease transmission, each with a brief description:

1. Direct Contact Transmission: Occurs when infectious agents are spread through direct physical contact between an infected person and a susceptible individual (e.g., touching, kissing, sexual contact).
2. Indirect Contact Transmission: Involves transmission through an intermediate object or surface (fomite), such as contaminated doorknobs, utensils, or medical equipment.
3. Droplet Transmission: Occurs when respiratory droplets carrying infectious agents are expelled by coughing, sneezing, or talking, and are inhaled by or come into contact with a nearby individual.
4. Airborne Transmission: Happens when infectious agents are suspended in the air as tiny particles (aerosols) and can be inhaled by people over distances beyond droplet transmission range (e.g., measles, tuberculosis).
5. Vector-borne Transmission: Involves the transmission of disease through organisms such as mosquitoes, ticks, or fleas



Here’s a list of common personal protective equipment (PPE) used by OEC technicians:

1. Gloves (usually nitrile or latex-free)
2. Protective eyewear (goggles or safety glasses)
3. Face masks or shields
4. Gowns or protective clothing
5. Resuscitation masks or bag-valve masks (BVM)
6. Boots or sturdy footwear

These items help protect both the technician and the patient from potential hazards and the spread of infections.
